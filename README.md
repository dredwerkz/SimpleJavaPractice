This is an ultra basic repo for some bare-bones Java backend stuff!
Doesn't do anything really, has an emulated storage class (think an S3 bucket or external API fetching from a db like Dynamo), a repository that handles said fetching, and a service to deal with some basic state and data manipulation.
Included are some very bare-bones tests just to get to grips with Java testing suites.
